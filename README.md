This project aims to predict vehicle prices in the Australian market using PySpark. The dataset includes multiple features like car type, fuel type, engine type, and more. The goal is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build a linear regression model to predict vehicle prices based on these features.
